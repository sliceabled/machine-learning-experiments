# machine-learning-experiments
an experiment to compare machine learning to cognitive human awareness and development
---
this experiment is a student research project aiming to find out if an artificial neural network learns faster than the average human.
---
the way this project will be tested will be through a basic game (i.e. snake) which will be programmed in python using the pygame package.
---
the machine learning will be coded and developed in jupyter notebook using tensorflow with some datasets potentially being used from keras or taken from [greerviau's SnakeAI](https://github.com/greerviau/SnakeAI)
---
branches will be divided into machine-learning and game-dev. this way both sides of the project can be worked on and submitted to master in pull requests.
